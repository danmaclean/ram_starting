# Starting at TSL

Here are some things to get going with this week. 

1. Get logged into `http://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk`
2. Work out how to build workflows
3. Fix `SNPCaller.ga`
4. Learn `ggplot2` 


## 1. Logging into TSL Galaxy
Being able to do this will mean that all your site accounts including your email address and permissions are set properly. This usually takes a bit of back and forth between Neil and Computing to get sorted, but once you've done it you should be ready to access all our stuff.

## 2. Building workflows 
Workflows are important aspects of Galaxy and one of the support jobs we have right now is to fix a workflow, so learning how to use the Galaxy interface and construct workflows is a nice place to begin. This website is the official Galaxy Wiki [https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/), [https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn). Work your way through the tutorials listed here: 

1. Galaxy 101 [http://screencast.g2.bx.psu.edu/galaxy101/](http://screencast.g2.bx.psu.edu/galaxy101/)
2. On FastqPrep in Galaxy [https://vimeo.com/76343659](https://vimeo.com/76343659)
3. On RNASeq in Galaxy [https://vimeo.com/131811959](https://vimeo.com/131811959)
4. On Building workflows [https://vimeo.com/131811955](https://vimeo.com/131811955)

## 3. Fix `SNPCaller.ga`

The file `SNPCaller.ga` in this repo is a (broken) Galaxy Workflow. It is broken because it comes from an older version of Galaxy that had different tools and tool names than our current one. To fix it you'll need to find equivalent tools in our Galaxy and use those instead. You may need to install new tools from the toolshed to do achieve this.

## 4. Learn `ggplot2`

Later this year we'll be doing a `ggplot` tutorial in `R`. You won't need to present, but you will be assisting in the class, so you'll need to know how to use the tool. Spend some time making graphs and finding tutorials to learn this package.
